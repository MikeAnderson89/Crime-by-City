# Crime-by-City

1. It is often assumed that violent crime is associated with a lack of education, causing perpetrators to venture outside of normal social and legal constructs and inflict harm on others. Is there a direct longitudinal correlation between violent crime rate and high school graduation rate?
2. There has also been a school of thought that perhaps offenders commit violent crimes because jobs and access to income are limited or altogether out of reach. Does higher income yield lower violent crime?
3. Now surely, we all have heard that the higher the poverty rate, the higher the crime rate. How accurate is the hearsay? Is high poverty in a city associated with high violent crime rate? If the poverty level decreases, can we show that violent crime rate does as well?
4. Can we find other expected correlations, such as graduation rates and household median income despite the consistency of violent crime in the observed areas?
